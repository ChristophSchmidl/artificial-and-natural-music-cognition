## Lecture 1: Intro

### Notes

* Partial: Component frequency. An elementary "part" of a sound that cannot be further broken apart. "Subsounds".
* Mode: Each manner of vibration is reffered to as "mode". Each mode has its own distinct frequency (or rate) of vibration for a given vibrating object.
* Hertz (Hz): The unit of frequency is the Hertz (Hz). One hertz is one cycle og movement per second. 
* Pure tone: When a sound source vibrates in only one mode it produces a single partial and the resulting sound is referred to as "pure tone".
* Complex tone: When a source vibrates in two or more modes it produces two or more partials and the resulting sound is referred to as a "complex tone"
* Fundamental frequency: The base/basic frequency in a series of frequencies where each successive frequency is a multiple of the base frequency.
* Harmonics: When partials have frequencies that are related by simple integer multiplies, they are referred to as "harmonics". These harmonics are also called "overtones".
* Important acoustic vibrators: vibrating strings, vibrating air-filled tubes, the human voice. They generate harmoic series.
* Instruments that produce inharmonic partials: drums, timpani, gongs, cymbals, marimbas, glockenspiels, vibraphones (everything played with a mallet or stick)
* Cochlea(latin: snail): The ossicles conduct the sound from the eardrum to the organ of hearing, the cochlea. The cochlea is a fluid-filled tube that is curled up so that it resembles a smal snail.
* Basilar membrane: a resonant structure that resides within the cochlea of the inner ear
* Eardrum -> basilar membrane
* Hair cells: sensory receptors of hearing.
that resides within the cochlea of the inner ear.
* Resolved partials: Two partials need to be at least 1 millimeter apart on the membrane for them to be reliably detected as separate sounds. When the basilar membrane successfully isolates a particular partial, we say that the partial has been resolved.
* Auditory image: Repackaging partials. For example, thirty frequencies generated by three physically vibrating strings (and resolved by the cochlea into perhaps eight partials) ultimately lead to the subjective impression of a single piano tone. 
* The auditory system is designed to recognize sound-producing objects rather than individual modes of vibration.
* Auditory scene analysis: Parsing an auditory image and may give labels to each sound source like "this is a trumpet, oboe and a sax"
* Source location: Sounds that come from the same location in space are more likely to come from the same physical sound source. Two principal cues: time delay and intensity.
* Stereo vs mono reproduction. Please and pain. When we listen to a mono recording, all of these localization cues are lost = loss of pleasure.
* Acoustic phenomena ("generated"): Something is said to be "acoustic" when it pertains to the physical world apart from human beings.
* Auditory phenomena ("evoked" or "perceived"): Something is said to be "auditory" when it pertains to the brain's interpretation of the sonic world.
* The violin "out there" is acoustical; the violin in your head is auditory.
* Auditory stream: The subjective image of a sound activity continuing over time.
* Fourier analysis: is the technique that allows us to analyze a complex sound into its sine-wave components
* Fourier synthesis: Construction of complex sounds from a set of sine waves
* Sound spectrum: the various sine-wave components of a complex sound are collectively referred to as the spectrum of frequency components, or simply, the sound spectrum.
* Period: The period is the time taken for one complete cycle of the waveform; it is the reciprocal of the repetition rate.
* Consonance and dissonance: Intervals are traditionally considered either consonant or dissonant. Consonant intervals are usually described as pleasant and agreeable. Dissonant intervals are those that cause tension and desire to be resolved to consonant intervals. These descriptions relate to harmonious intervals.

### Assignments

* Recommended to read this very nice and easy-to-read chapter by David Huron (2016)

## Lecture 2: Repetition


### Notes

### Assignments

* Read Margulis 2013, post things that you disagree with Margulis. You can also post things that are unclear. 
* Play with the Tonematrix: http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/. What tricks are used to make this work? Try to describe as many tricks as possible and post them below. Descriptions based on your intuition is good, but also try to make an explicit link with music theory (http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/ suggested concepts: Measures and Time signature / Simple and Compound Meter / The Major scale / The Minor scale / Scale degrees)
* Think of a musical example that crossed your mind while reading Margulis chapter. Post a youtube link (with specific time stamp (https://www.lifewire.com/link-to-specific-part-of-youtube-video-1616414) and briefly describe why it is relevant.
