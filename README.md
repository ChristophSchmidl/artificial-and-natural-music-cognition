## Lecture 1: Intro

* Recommended to read this very nice and easy-to-read chapter by David Huron (2016)

## Lecture 2: Repetition

* Read Margulis 2013, post things that you disagree with Margulis. You can also post things that are unclear. 
* Play with the Tonematrix: http://tonematrix.audiotool.com/. What tricks are used to make this work? Try to describe as many tricks as possible and post them below. Descriptions based on your intuition is good, but also try to make an explicit link with music theory (http://www.musictheory.net/lessons/ suggested concepts: Measures and Time signature / Simple and Compound Meter / The Major scale / The Minor scale / Scale degrees)
* Think of a musical example that crossed your mind while reading Margulis chapter. Post a youtube link (with specific time stamp (https://www.lifewire.com/link-to-specific-part-of-youtube-video-1616414) and briefly describe why it is relevant.
