The simuli files have the following structure:
- song_Xorg.mid the original song
- song_X_candidate_0.mid the generated song of the autoencoder
- song_X_org_auto.mid reconstruction of the orginal song of the autoencoder

So we want to use song_Xorg.mid as the original song file and compare it against song_X_candidate_0.mid.
